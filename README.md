HR Analytics - Employee Attrition Prediction

Project Description
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict attrition using machine learning models. Employee attrition prediction can help organizations proactively address retention challenges, improve workplace satisfaction, and reduce costs associated with turnover.

Key Features
- Data preprocessing and handling of imbalanced datasets.
- Implementation of various machine learning models including Logistic Regression and XGBoost.
- Use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.
Dataset
- Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset.
- Contains demographic, professional, and performance details of employees.

 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection : Imported the dataset for analysis.
2. Preprocessing : 
   - Encoded categorical features.
   - Balanced data using SMOTE for improved model performance.
3. Model Building**: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models.
4. Model Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best model.
5. Results**: XGBoost with SMOTE provided the best balance for predicting attrition.
